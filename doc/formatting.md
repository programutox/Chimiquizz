# How to add formulas and chemical names to the game

## Files

There are three files containing the formulas and chemical names: `entities1.lvl`, `entities2.lvl` and `entities3.lvl`, the number corresponding to the difficulty. They can be found in the folder `assets/data/levels`.


## Formatting your line

To add new chemical elements to the files, you have to separate each element with the `::` operator. 
`french_name::english_name_or_symbols::good_answer::wrong_answer1::wrong_answer2::wrong_answer3`
Example: `Amidure::Azanide::NH₂⁻::NH::NH₃::NH₄⁺`

You don't have to worry about the order of the wrong answers, as it will be randomized with the good answer in the game.

Spaces are allowed.

`Acide chlorhydrique::Hydrochloric acid::HCl::KCl::H₂Cl₂::HCl₂`

Comments start with `//` .

`// This line will be ignored by the program.`


## Symbols and ids

Instead of writing the English names for each element you add, you can use symbols.
The `*` symbol means that the french chemical name will be picked (accents are removed).

To simplify the following examples, I will write `(...) ` instead of `good_answer::wrong_answer1::wrong_answer2::wrong_answer3`

Example: `Acétate::*::(...) `=> `Acetate`

You can add ids after `*` to not only pick the french chemical name and remove accents, but also add other modifications to it.

- `*i` replaces last occurence of y by i.
`Hydroxyde::*i::(...)` => `Hydroxide`

- `*l` removes the last character.
`Hydrogène::*l::(...)` => `Hydrogen`
- `*ium` removes the last character and adds ium suffix. `Chrome::*ium::(...)` => `Chromium`
- `*ide` replaces `ure` suffix by `ide`.
`Chlorure::*ide::(...)` => `Chloride`
- `*rev` interchanges the words and removes French preposition.
`Cyanate de sodium::*rev::(...)` => `Sodium cyanate`

- `*rev` also translates `argent` into `silver`, as many elements of the files have it. `Iodate d'argent::*rev::(...)` => `Silver iodate`
- `*acid` interchanges the words, changes the suffix (from `ique` to `ic`) and capitalizes the result.
`Acide maléique` => `Maleic acid`

You can call multiples symbols by separating them using the `:` operator. All modifications will be made in order.

`Peroxyde d'hydrogène::*l:*rev:*i::(...)`
1. `*l` => `Peroxyde d'hydrogen`
1. `*rev` => `Hydrogen peroxyde`
1. `*i` => `Hydrogen peroxide`

You can also use several times the same symbol.

`Hydroxyde de baryum::*i:*rev:*i::(...)`
1. `*i` => `Hydroxyde de barium`
1. `*rev` => `Barium hydroxyde`
1. `*i` => `Barium hydroxide`
